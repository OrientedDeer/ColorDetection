# ColorDetection

The goal of this program was to find the most common color in my living room. I found a dataset online with colors names and their corresponding rgb values. With this I calculated how many times each color in my dataset was the closest to a pixel in my image. I turned this into a pandas dataframe and found a fun library to plot it.

If I came back to this project I would want to make a program that recreated the image but only with the 15 or so most common colors. So it sort of worked like a blur/pixelation but not based on nearby colors.
